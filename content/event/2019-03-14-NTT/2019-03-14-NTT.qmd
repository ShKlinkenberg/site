In this talk we discussed the state of large scale digital assessment in higher education and what is needed to facilitate accessibility. The main take away, first make sure you have an established infrastructure for regular digital assessment and build your [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) layer on top of that.

My challenge to the National network on Accessibility Assessment: Write a model policy memorandum which outlines the needs and course of action to facilitate accessible digital assessment.
