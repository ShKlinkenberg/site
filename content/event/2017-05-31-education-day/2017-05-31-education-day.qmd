Want to get the most out of your students? This is what you need to know: course design should be focused on assessing student ability, diagnosing weaknesses and strengths, remediation and challenging your top students. In this workshop, we will share what we have already learned on creating such a course at the department of Psychology. At the end of the workshop you will have the necessary toolkit and mindset to get started on building your own personalized blended learning student environment.
